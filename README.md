# PQuIP Group

A simple, fast GitHub Pages website for a research group.

## Quick Start (GitHub Web UI)
1. Create a **new public repository** on GitHub (e.g., `pquip-group-site`).
2. Download this repo ZIP from ChatGPT, extract it locally.
3. In your new GitHub repo, click **Add file → Upload files** and drag‑drop the *contents* of the extracted folder (not the folder itself).
4. Commit to the **main** branch.
5. Go to **Settings → Pages**. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** = *Deploy from a branch*. Choose **Branch** = `main` and **Folder** = `/ (root)`. Click **Save**.
6. Your site will be published at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

## Customize
- Edit `index.html`, `people.html`, etc.
- Replace placeholders under `assets/img/` with real photos and logos.
- If you add a custom domain later, add a `CNAME` file at the repo root.
