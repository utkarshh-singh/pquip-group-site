<!-- ABOUT (no title) -->
<section id="about">
  <p>I am a PhD candidate in Physics at the University of Ottawa, specializing in Quantum Machine Learning in collaboration with the National Research Council of Canada. My research focuses on developing resource-efficient quantum algorithms, with two patented methods advancing this direction. Alongside academia, I am an entrepreneur with prior experience in the quantum industry, where I led efforts to translate quantum research into practical applications. My vision is to make quantum-enhanced AI accessible and impactful across domains such as materials discovery, finance, and sustainability. I am also deeply committed to fostering the next generation of quantum innovators through teaching, outreach, and community building.</p>
